# Turning Household Items into Craft Ideas with AI


Imagine looking at random objects lying around your house and instantly being able to visualize creative ways to turn them into unique craft projects. This is exactly what the Picture-Based DIY Craft AI Generator does. Based on Wordware.ai, this tool helps to create specific ideas for home crafting with the help of AI. Just upload an image and let the AI come up with a craft idea for you!

    If you want the image or any kind of a file in output from AI , make sure to mention that here. In this case, we’re asking the AI to provide an image along with the craft idea.
