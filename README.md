# Turning Household Items into Craft Ideas with AI 🖼️🎨


Imagine looking at random objects lying around your house and instantly being able to visualize creative ways to turn them into unique craft projects. This is exactly what the Picture-Based DIY Craft AI Generator does. Based on Wordware.ai, this tool helps to create specific ideas for home crafting with the help of AI. Just upload an image and let the AI come up with a craft idea for you!

 ## ⚙️ **How to Get Started:**

 1. **Sign in to Wordware.ai**🔑
    
    Go to [Wordware.ai](https://www.wordware.ai/) and sign in. Once you're logged in, you're ready to start creating your craft generator.

2. **Create a New Project**🛠️
    
   Click the Create a New Project button. This is where you'll set up the project that powers your DIY craft generator.

3. **Start a Flow** 

    Next, click Create a New Flow. Give your flow a name and choose the type of input you want (Image, Text, File, Audio). For this project, select Image because you’ll be uploading 
   pictures of objects.

4. **Set the Output** 🖼️
    
    If you want the image or any kind of a file in output from AI, make sure to mention A prompt for the previously created output in the Image generation step. In this case, we’re 
   asking the AI to provide an image along with the craft idea.
